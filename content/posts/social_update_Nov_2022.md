summary: "How to find me elsewhere"
---

Like most people, with the imminent death of the Bird Site, I am moving my main social media presence elsewhere.

I have created both a:

- [Cohost Account](https://cohost.org/phalanxhead) - For praise of Eggbug
- [Fediverse Account](https://tech.lgbt/@phalanxhead) - For less deep shitposting being more explicitly trans-y

Please note that I am not having any intention of filtering adult content on either of these accounts.
Real life is not always Safe for Work, and I don't intend to censor myself for that purpose.

Feel free to simply not follow me if that is a bother.

I will repost most of my serious blogs from here on both of those though, because discoverability is hard without social media!

> 2023 Edit: I forgot to update my fediverse account after I moved due to a whole bunch of Eightpoint Drama - don't worry about it. I've changed it now lol.
