An introduction to writing unit tests in Typescript with Jest.

This tutorial was originally written as a Rust mdbook, however I'm having issues with 
Hugo (my SSG) and Github Pages wanting to actually serve the blob of the output mdbook,
and I really am not certain why.

As such, I've embedded it into this site so the content is a little more accessible than just the
(thankfully working) PDF, though the rendering isn't how I imagined it to begin with.
