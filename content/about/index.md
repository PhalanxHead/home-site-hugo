My name is Luka. I am a software developer from Melbourne, Australia. ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º <br/> My pronouns are she/her. :transgender_flag:

I have moderate experience on the entire tech stack, but don't particularly specialise in any one area. I do prefer to work on back-end projects. My current work has been focused on AWS Lambda and AWS CDK, especially dabbling in TypeScript.

While at University, I tutored First Year Algorithms. This included the basics of Python, C, and algorithmic complexity.

I've been working in the software industry for 3 years (since February 2019)

## Education
I graduated university with a Bachelor of Science (Majoring in Computing and Software Systems) from the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au) in 2018.

## Work History
### Two Bulls (2021 - Present)

In 2021, I moved to work at [Two Bulls](https://twobulls.com), where I have happily been working on government software projects.

Much of my work here has been using `aws-cdk` and TypeScript running on AWS Lambda.

In the course of this, I've picked up skills with [`projen`](https://github.com/projen/projen), [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/), and a bit of systems and security design.

### DXC Technology(2019 - 2021)
Fresh out of university, I joined [DXC Technology](https://dxc.com) as a graduate developer.

My main area of focus here was XR Applications, especially working with the Microsoft HoloLens 2 and the Oculus Quest 2 in Unity. A lot of our work was proof of concept training work, the most exciting project of which was an assessment application for Standard operating Procedure compliance in the Utilities industry.

I also led development and go-live for a web portal refresh that was written in Angular and .NET Core.

### The University of Melbourne (2018 - 2019)
During my final year of University, I tutored first year students on the basics of programming. The core areas of the subjects were introduction to Python, introduction to C and algorithmic analysis using Big O notation.
