                <p>My name is Luka. I am a software developer from Melbourne, Australia. &#x1F1E6;&#x1F1FA;</p>
                <p>I have moderate experience on the entire tech stack, but don't particularly specialise in any one area. I do prefer to work on back end projects.</p>
                <p>While at University, I tutored First Year Algorithms. This included the basics of Python, C, and algorithmic complexity.</p>
                <p>I've been working in the software industry for <span id="work-years-counter"></span> years (since February 2019)</p>

                <p>My main area of focus here was XR Applications, especially working with the Microsoft HoloLens 2 and the Oculus Quest 2 in Unity. A lot of our work was proof of concept training work, the most exciting project of which was an assessment
                    application for Standard operating Procedure compliance in the Utilities industry.</p>
