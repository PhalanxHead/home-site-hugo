            <h2>This Website!</h2>
            <p>This website is an attempt for me to delve into the world of raw HTML 5. It's almost completely hand-written HTML, with no use of frameworks unless absolutely necessary... <a href="projects/this-site.html">Continue content</a></p>

            <h2>Ten Thousand Lesbians</h2>
            <p>Ten Thousand Lesbians is an art piece written in Cocos Creator.</p>
            <p>It is a randomly-generated cube map, where each cube is placed in a random position in the camera's viewport, and adopts one of the 7 colours from the lesbian <em>Orange and Pink</em> flag.</p>
            <p>This project also details a short history of the Lesbian Flag and its development... <a href="projects/tenthousandlesbians">Continue Content</a></p>

            <h3>Essential & Endeavour Energy VR Training</h3>
            <p>While working at DXC, I was the Lead Developer on a VR Project for Essential and Endeavour Energy, two NSW-based utilities companies.</p>
            <p>The goal was to virtualise their compliance testing for a set of Standard Operating Procedures - in essence, to test that electricians can safely do their jobs before even entering a real-life site.</p>

            <h2>GrainContracker</h2>
            <p>GrainContracker was a plan I had to track the offered contract prices of certain Grain Commodities over time.</p>
            <p>The project was going to be an F# + Elmish serverless exploration, for me to see how easy it is to build out a site in F#.</p>
            <p>Traditionally, contract prices are offered daily, and only via a PDF. There are no efforts to track the price over time, or map it against other data like weather events or world news.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the grain companies changed how price sheets are offered into a less accessible manner, and I couldn't keep the effort up on top of my day job.</p>
